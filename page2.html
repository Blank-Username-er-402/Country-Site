        <p>France's love for food is well known whats even more well know is their love for cheese. <br>
            France produces around 1,500 different types of cheese each year and is one of the largest <br>
            producers and consumers in the world producing around 1.9 million tons each year. Many of <br>
            frances foods include cheese and cheese is a staple food for most French. For example in my time <br>
            in france cheese was always an appetizer before the main meal. Its needless to say that France loves <br>
            food (and cheeses!) and their culture produces some of the best food in the world. On average there are <br>
            two books a day being produced on French cuisine.
