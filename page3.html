            France while being a cultural hotspot and tourist attraction is only, in fact, about the size of Texas. <br>
            In fact its even a little smaller at 1.2 times smaller than Texas it would only make up about 81.34% of <br>
            Texas. Even while being smaller than a U.S state Frances geography is a patchwork of beauty, ranging from <br>
            warm sunkissed shores on the Mediterenean coast to tall and snowy mountains and valleys that many skiers <br>
            call home. You cant forget the sprawling metropolis of Paris dotted with museums and and pieces of history <br>
            seemingly dragged into a modern age. The geography is truly incredible with forests so unique you would <br>
            believe you went back into the past in a fantasy world. In many parts of France there are snapshots of the past: <br>
            ancient castles dating back as far as 850 AD.
